# section508.json

Section 508 in JSON format for filtering, parsing and other cool stuff.

## Why?

I got the idea after finding the [wcag.json](https://github.com/justinmarsan/wcag.json) library. Since I have to use 508 in addition to WCAG2, I decided to make this available. As much as possible, I tried to stick to the data definitions established by the wcag.json library.

## License

Do what you want with it, I don't care, just make sure you don't do anything evil, give credit or don't, doesn't matter either.

## Roadmap

* Create a list of known GPATs and how they apply to Section 508
* Add `situations` for different agencies and their individual `techniques` for testing Section 508.
